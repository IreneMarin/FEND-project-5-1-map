## Neighborhood Map project

Part 1 of the fifth project from the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree in <a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a>: 
<br>
developing a single-page application featuring a map of a neighborhood, adding additional functionality to this application.

-------------------

### How to run the application 

Download the repository in your desktop, unzip it and open the "index.html" file in your browser to run the project. 

Or you can open it here: [Neighbourhood Map](http://irenemarin.github.io/FEND-project-5-1-map/)

### Attributions

For this project, I have used the [Knockout JS framework](http://knockoutjs.com/), the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview) and the [Sidr jQuery toggle function](https://www.berriart.com/sidr/).

To help me get through it, I have used different resources, like: 

[Live search with knockout.js](http://opensoul.org/2011/06/23/live-search-with-knockoutjs/)

[KnockoutJS and Google Maps binding](http://www.hoonzis.com/knockoutjs-and-google-maps-binding/)

### Udacity's instructions

You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

1. Review our course JavaScript Design Patterns.
2. Download the Knockout framework.
3. Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
4. Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations you are interested in within this neighborhood.
5. Implement the search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
6. Implement a list view of the identified locations.
7. Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our Intro to AJAX course.
